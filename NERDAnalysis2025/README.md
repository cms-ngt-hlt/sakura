#  NERD Analysis 2025

A set of scripts used for the analysis in four categories:

1. EGamma\_fullStats

Re-HLT of all the runs we have applied ecal-related calibrations to with the demonstrator, full statistics.
 
2. EGamma\_HLT\_TestData

Re-HLT of all the runs we have applied ecal-related calibrations to with the demonstrator, requiring for the event to have passed the filter `HLT_TestData_v*`.

3. Muon\_fullStats

Re-HLT of all the run we have applied SST-related calibrations to with the demonstrator, full statistics.

4. Muon\_HLT\_TestData

Re-HLT of all the run we have applied SST-related calibrations to with the demonstrator, requiring for the event to have passed the filter `HLT_TestData_v*`.
